against which you want to compare your current files 

git reset --soft HEAD~

# Rename a branch
1. Rename your local branch.
If you are on the branch you want to rename:

git branch -m new-name

If you are on a different branch:

git branch -m old-name new-name

2. Delete the old-name remote branch and push the new-name local branch.

git push origin :old-name new-name

3. Reset the upstream branch for the new-name local branch.
Switch to the branch and then:

git push origin -u new-name
